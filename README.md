               I learned all about selectors in CSS which applies certain codes to certain classes, elements, and types.
            </p>

               Today I learned about specificity, chaining, descendant combinators, and an HTML element can have two or more CSS selectors at the same time by typing
               the element first, the period, and the class. Example: h1.special { }
            </p>

            <p>
               So today, I learned about chaining and specificity. For example if .main is the class and is .main p { color: red; } this means that the p type as the 
               selector inside the .main element will appear red. Remember, class is not as specific as type. 
            </p>

               What a productive and tiring day! I completed a project using CSS Selectors. The project is called "Healthy Recipes" and the goal is to transform the 
               HTML only webpage into a whole new and exciting webpage using CSS. In this project, I used the image selector and adjusted the size of the photo so that
               it's smaller and even transformed the bulleted points of an unordered list from circles to squares. How amazing is that? Next I'll be doing another
               project by using CSS visual rules and creating rule sets to improve the appearance of a portfolio webpage.

            <p>
            Today I learned that buttons aren't acceptable here. As seen below.
            </p> 
      <button>Do not click!</button>
            <aside>Please do not click on the button above. I really mean it. It's a useless button</aside>

            I finished up the CSS project "Olivia Woodruff Portfolio" on Codecademy with a bit of help from the step by step hints optional to your learning process.
            Though I've only progressed up to 4%, I realized that this learning process is almost like traveling back to when websites were mostly made with simple 
            HTML, moving on to CSS, and then evolving into more powerful versions with the hands of JavaScript. I still know little to nothing about JS but soon that
            will change!
            </p>

            Note: I recently started an account with Testbirds. There, I hope to gain experience from the feedbacks of web development professionals even if the pay
            isn't that exuberant. Testbirds is a site where testers seek any errors or functionality issues with company sites and in return, earn compensation for
            what they find with the amounts dependent on the amount of information provided. They will prioritize on testers who have a more completed profile so if a
            tester submits a bug report with a completed profile, their report will be reviewed first. The only thing I have left to complete is the "Specialty 
            Knowledge" section.

            Hello github, it has been a while since I've visited you. I was busy trying to get all my work done for my day job before my big trip to Zion National Park
            in Utah (Only 4 days, yay!). Long story short, the trip was amazing! The journey there was interesting, and I was witness to big beautiful rocky mountains,
            wild deers, and really red murky rivers! Anyway, here's an update to my learning journey. I am still at 4% during my Codecademy learning journey. I have
            applied to help out at a local library to guide and coach in their technology department as a volunteer. I hope that I'll be able to do this and gain
            experience in the tech field!
            </p>
