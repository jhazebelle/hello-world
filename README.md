               I learned all about selectors in CSS which applies certain codes to certain classes, elements, and types.

               Today I learned about specificity, chaining, descendant combinators, and an HTML element can have two or more CSS selectors at the same time by typing
               the element first, the period, and the class. Example: h1.special { }
            </p>

               So today, I learned about chaining and specificity. For example if .main is the class and is .main p { color: red; } this means that the p type as the 
               selector inside the .main element will appear red. Remember, class is not as specific as type.
